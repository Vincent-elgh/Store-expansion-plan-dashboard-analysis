# Store Expansion Plan Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze and support the expansion plan of "24 Seven", a 24-hour convenience store chain in Canada. We created an interactive dashboard to identify the optimal location for a new store, analyze sales trends, and forecast sales demand.

## Objectives
- Strategically Locate the New Store: Utilize open-source datasets to determine the most accessible and reliable location.
- Analyze Sales Trends: Gain insights into 24 Seven's performance and customer preferences.
- Forecast Sales Demand: Implement advanced predictive analytics for informed decision-making.
## Data Collection & Cleaning
We collected external data from various sources, including Statistics Canada and Couche-Tard store locations, focusing on population demographics, economic indicators, and competitive analysis. The data underwent thorough cleaning and standardization for use in Power BI.

## Use Cases
- Optimal Location: Analyzes existing store distribution, economic indicators, and competition density to recommend a location for the new store.
- Sales Trends: Reviews historical sales data and demographic information to understand sales dynamics.
- Forecasting Sales Demand: Utilizes regression models to predict future sales volumes and conduct scenario analyses.
## Business Implications
Our analysis reveals Rouyn-Noranda as the ideal location for the new store based on several factors such as high population, low competition, and favorable economic conditions. The insights provided by the dashboards can guide 24 Seven in making data-driven decisions regarding market entry strategies, inventory planning, and promotional activities.

## Dashboards & Insights
The project features multiple Power BI dashboards that offer comprehensive insights into the potential success of new store locations, sales performance, customer demographics, and predictive sales forecasts. These dashboards are instrumental for strategic planning and operational improvements.
